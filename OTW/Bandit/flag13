data.txt is a hexdump of the flag that has been heavily compressed.

mkdir /tmp/jakembandit12 && cp data.txt /tmp/jakembandit12 && cd /tmp/jakembandit12
reverse hexdump data.txt
cat data.txt | xxd -r > reversedata
check the file with 'file'
mv to change the file extension
decompress with gzip; bzip2; tar -xvf
----had to decompress this like almost 10 times----

until we got a ascii text file:
