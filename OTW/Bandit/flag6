Password for the next level is stored in the ONLY human readable file:

cd inhere; ls -al
there are about 19 subfolders.
ls -aR 
there are 9 files in each sub folder
6 binaries and 3 normal files

let's just dump everything out

cd ..
for i in *; do cd "$i" && cat ./-file2 && echo '*****************' && cat spaces\ file2 && echo '********************' && cat .file2 && echo '****************' && cd ..; done > /tmp/dump.txt

skimming thru this huge text dump there's a file with only 1 text line and a huge white space
