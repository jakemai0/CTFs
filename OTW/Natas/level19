So the same as level18, but no more sourcecode, only hint is "This page uses mostly the same code as the previous level, but session IDs are no longer sequential..."
PHPSESSID is generated "randomly", but the last few characters are identical, here are samples of 10 PHPSESSIDs when tried with admin as username

3232382 d61646d696e
3434322 d61646d696e
3633372 d61646d696e
3330362 d61646d696e
3630372 d61646d696e
38302   d61646d696e
3334342 d61646d696e
362     d61646d696e
3335322 d61646d696e
3332342 d61646d696e

when username is something like: helllooooooooooo
PHPSESSID is going to be something like: 3336342d68656c6c6f6f6f6f6f6f6f6f6f6f6f6f
seems like some sort of special encoding????

when username is left blank, PHPSESSID is gonna be something like: 3531372d, random int ends with 2d at the end => google says this is some sort of
data matrix encoding

Turned out I was way off, it actually hex encoded, 2d is hex encoded for '-'
61646d696e is 'admin' encoded in hex

So maybe thing is still the same, admin session is still from 1-640, but the PHPSESSID is just encoded in hex
Refer to level19.py

Eventually we got it,
after hours of trying with just 1-640 followed by '-', it turns out we have to
include 'admin' as well, like for example '123-admin', not just '123-'
Admin PHPSESSID is 3238312d61646d696e, encoded from '281-admin'
