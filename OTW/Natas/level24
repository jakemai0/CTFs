same as the previous level, a password submission form

if(array_key_exists("passwd",$_REQUEST)){
        if(!strcmp($_REQUEST["passwd"],"<censored>")){
            echo "<br>The credentials for the next level are:<br>";

strcmp() compares 1 string to another string

well obviously we don't know the password, so we need to find another way
to get strcmp() function to return 0

I played around with it and got it working :/
passwd[]
