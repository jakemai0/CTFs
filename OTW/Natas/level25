we have a block of text:
language option to display, and the source code

seems to be like another path traversal attack.

in the safeinclude function:
// check for directory traversal
        if(strstr($filename,"../")){
            logRequest("Directory traversal attempt! fixing request.");
            $filename=str_replace("../","",$filename);
        }
        // dont let ppl steal our passwords
        if(strstr($filename,"natas_webpass")){
            logRequest("Illegal file access detected! Aborting!");
            exit(-1);
        }

the webserver converts '../' with '' to disallow direct dir traversal, BUT, we can inject '../' inside '../' -> '..././
when php removes '../', we got left with '../' -> win

we won't be able to traverse directly to the natas_webpass dir -> we can work around by injecting code execution in another place.

we also know the location of the log file, and we are able to see it:
function logRequest($message){
        $log="[". date("d.m.Y H::i:s",time()) ."]";
        $log=$log . " " . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
        $log=$log . " \"" . $message ."\"\n"; 
        $fd=fopen("/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log","a");
        fwrite($fd,$log);
        fclose($fd);
    }

try sending a post request with lang=..././..././..././
we are getting somewhere.

now let's try to go to the log file.
$fd=fopen("/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log","a");
(open file, appending mode, dir path + sessid + .log extension)

3 dir up didn't work, 4 dir up didn't work, 5 dir up, worked!!!

log message: [25.11.2019 00::36:05] python-requests/2.22.0 "Directory traversal attempt! fixing request."
$log="[". date("d.m.Y H::i:s",time()) ."]";
$log=$log . " " . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
$log=$log . " \"" . $message ."\"\n"; 
$fd=fopen("/var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_" . session_id() .".log","a");

we have time, user agent and actual message.

I didn't know actually have control over the user_agent, in order to perform remote code injection/execution
