We have a username and password login form.
if we enter a new user with a password => create a  new user
enter username as natas28 and password => wrong credentials for natas28 => we need to find this
password

DB is resetted every 5 mins

/*
   CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `username` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
  `password` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL

   );
*/

okay so the trick here is the varchar(64), when we enter something > than 64,
the behavior of mysql will be: grabbing the data within the size and truncate the rest
