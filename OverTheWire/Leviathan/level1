we have a binary "check"
when we run it, it asks for the password, and then verifies it.
strings check: nothing much
strace: doesn't show a lot
ltrace: we can see that the strcmp function is used to compare
the entered password against "sex"

=> password is sex
we are now user leviathan2, cd to /etc/leviathan_pass and cat leviathan2
we got: ougahZi8Ta
