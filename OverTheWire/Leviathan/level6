so we gotta execute the binary with a 4 digits number,
seems like a brute force one.
I wrote a Python script but then realised how easy it was to do it
in shell script intead.
Python script:
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
import os
n = 0
while n <= 9999:
    os.system("~/leviathan6 '%04d%n'")
	print("%04d%n")
    n+=1

Shell script:
for i in {0000..9999}; do echo $i; ~/leviathan6 $i; done

the script stops at 7123 > secret passcode
now we cat /etc/leviathan_pass/*
