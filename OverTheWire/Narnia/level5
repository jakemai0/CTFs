Looking at the source code:
We have i = 1, and a buffer[64]
What we need to do, is to modify the value of i from 1 to 500
the program will then spawn a shell.

hint is the address of i: 
i = 1 (0xffffd6e0)

the function snprintf is used to copy the input from agrv[1] to the buffer
so we won't be able to overflow it easily.

But this is surely some sort of injection to modify variable value from the
stack.

CYBR271 actually had an example on this: format string vuln.

Let's try with ./narnia5 %x%x%x: (%x prints out data on the stack)
Change i's value from 1 -> 500. No way...let me give you a hint!
buffer : [f7fc50003030303530333033] (24)
i = 1 (0xffffd6e0)

We're getting somewhere.
