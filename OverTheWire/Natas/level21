Again, we need to get the print_credentials() function to spit out
the flag for the next level by getting $_SESSION["admin"] == 1

There is a hint: Note: this website is colocated with http://natas21-experimenter.natas.labs.overthewire.org
Not much on the other site, we can change the alignment, font size and colour
of the "Hello world!" text to be printed on the screen.

Turning on the debug mode on the natas21-experimenter, we can have a better idea
of how the submission works.

**************The easy way*************
Use Burp to intercept and modify the request:
we know that we need a key-value pair of admin and 1
When submitting a form:

align=center&fontsize=100%25&bgcolor=yellow&submit=Update

Slide the key-value pair in: 
align=center&fontsize=100%25&bgcolor=yellow&submit=Update&admin=1
copy the PHPSESSID

Head to the main site, refresh, intercept, paste the PHPSESSID in

*************The python way**************

Pretty simple as well, refer to level21.py
