we have a password submission form

Source code:
if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 )){
            echo "<br>The credentials for the next level are:<br>";

strstr function in php finds the first occurance of a substring in a string 
so iloveyou must be in the password and password must be > 10 (why does it compare a string to an int????)

after doing some googling, I found this:
String conversion to numbers

When a string is evaluated in a numeric context, the resulting value and type are determined as follows.

The string will be evaluated as a float if it contains any of the characters '.', 'e', or 'E'. Otherwise, it will be evaluated as an integer.

The value is given by the initial portion of the string.
If the string starts with valid numeric data, this will be the value used.
Otherwise, the value will be 0 (zero).
Valid numeric data is an optional sign, followed by one or more digits (optionally containing a decimal point),
followed by an optional exponent. The exponent is an 'e' or 'E' followed by one or more digits.

I threw in 12iloveyousomuch, the server spits out the flag.
12iloveyousomuch contains substring iloveyou, and it's evaluated to 12, which > 10
