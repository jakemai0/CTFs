Learned how to use BurpSuite to intercept HTTP requests in order to solve this level.

The server only accepts requests coming from natas5 => we have to spoof referer in the http
header

Fire up BurpSuite, intercept the http request when hitting Refresh Page.

In the Intercept tab, modify the referer to http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
then forward the request.

Access granted. The password for natas5 is iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq
