Marked as an easy box, leshgo
nmap only shows port 80 open
Checking out the websites, not much around

-> found /dev through gobuster
-> there is a php file that will give us a shell
cd /home/arrexel
user pwned!

------------------------------------------------------

Create a python reverse shell to get a better shell, run linpeas script.
-> there is  (scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL
sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash

Escalated to scriptmanager user
scriptmanager has access to /scripts while www-data does not
Poking around, test.py writes a text to test.txt
This seems like it's being run periodically
-> very likely to be cronjob by root since test.txt is owned by root.

f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing123!")
f.close()

Since this will run by root:
echo "f = open('test.txt', 'w'); f.write(open('/root/root.txt', 'r').read())" >> test.py

After a wee bit, /root/root.txt will be written to test.txt
root pwned!
