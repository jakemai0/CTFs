Easy Misc Challenge

* 	* 	*

Unzipped the archive, there's a password protected pdf file.

file 0ld\ is\ g0ld.pdf 
0ld is g0ld.pdf: PDF document, version 1.6

Went through tons of trouble cracking the password,
from using John, HashCat, I even managed to break my kali for trying to installing driver for the GPU (in order to break it faster with HashCat), until I found pdfcrack online.
Used the given passwd dict given in kali: </usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt>

<./pdfcrack -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f ~/CTFs/htb/0ld\ is\ g0ld/0ld\ is\ g0ld.pd>

Mananged to crack it less than 3 minutes:
<found user-password: 'jumanji69'>

PDF is an image? Thought this was some sort of stegno, and there's something at the bottom.
Seems like Morse Code, I've seen it before in a PicoCTF challenge.
