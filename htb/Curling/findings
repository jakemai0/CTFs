Inspect the site shows there is a secret.txt located at 10.10.10.150/secret.txt
Likely to be a password credential for an user: Q3VybGluZzIwMTgh, looks like b64 -> b64 decoded: Curling2018!

Recon shows that the site uses Joomla as its Content Management System -> need to get login creds.
We may have had the password, now just need to find an username.

Among a few of the posts on the homepage, one of the username is Floris
Let's try this creds:
floris
Curling2018!

=> we managed to get in Joomla console with this creds.

After some probing, we can modify the index.php template of the site.
We can inject a php snippet code that calls a reverse shell.

After getting a shell, we found a file called password_backup on the server.
Grabed this to our local machine, it's an ascii file with hex content.
Reverse with xxd -r
Turned out it's a nested compression, with tar, bzip2 and gzip.
After decompressing, we got a password.txt -> likely to be the ssh password for floris

We managed to ssh in floris with this password.
User pwned.

Prives:
Linpeas enum did not show anything interesting.
In the local dir, we found a folder called admin-area, with 2 files: input and report.
Owned by root and modifiable -> likely to be prives vector

Inside "input" the localhost ip: 127.0.0.1 and inside "report" has the content of the original html page.
After some poking, the file "input" sorta makes a curl command to the pointed url
we can curl local file with: curl file://
-> modify the url with "url = "file:///root/root.txt"
this is a cronjob so after a few sec, "report" will has the content of the root flag.
Root pwned.
