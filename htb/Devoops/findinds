port 22 and 5000 are open.
5000 is a http port with Gunicorn running (some sort of python web gateway)
/upload <- users can upload xml file here -> potential RCE vector?
/feed <-img 

Tried uploading a sample xml file:
"PROCESSED BLOGPOST: Author: Jake Subject: Cook Content: Food URL for later reference: /uploads/sample.xml File path: /home/roosa/deploy/src"

-> uploaded files are stored at /uploads/
File path on the server is at: /home/roosa/deploy/src

possible username: roosa?

XML upload -> can attempt XXE attack?

test the XXE vulnerability with test.xml (XML parser parses external entity)
-> got the same result

Modifed the test.xml to cat /etc/passwd

3 users have login shell:
root
git
roosa

Tried to cat ssh key of git and roosa

roosa private ssh key grabbed successfully -> ssh session as roosa.

User pwned!

----------------------------------------------------

Prives:
found a .git folder in roosa's home directory
in side .git, there are logs, theres a log with a "revert using a wrong key"
git log to grab commit id
git show to show the commit history

tried to grab the deleted key

-> root's ssh private key

Root Pwned!
