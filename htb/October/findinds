initial foothold by logging in the site with admin:admin credentials
upload a reverse shell and get user shell, pretty straight forward.

Prives:
enum script shows a suid program called ovrflw, asking for a string input.
-> Buffer Overflow exploit.
NX on the binary is enabled and ASLR on the host OS is on.
-> ret2libc and ASLR bruteforce

find the offset with input fuzzing: offset is 112
locate libc mem addr: ldd ovrflw | grep libc
find the offset of system() and exit() with readelf -s 'libc location' | grep system,exit
grab the address of "/bin/sh" with strings -t x 'libc location' | grep "/bin/sh"

build the exploit:
padding is 112 bytes long, followed by system ptr, exit ptr, /bin/sh ptr

run the exploit in a loop.

-> popped root shell.
Very enjoyable prives exploitation with bof :)
